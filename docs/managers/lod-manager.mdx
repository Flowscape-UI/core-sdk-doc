# LODManager

The Level of Detail (LOD) system reduces visual complexity at lower zoom levels and increases detail at higher zoom levels.

> Note: If the LOD API is experimental, treat this as conceptual guidance.

## Example Strategy

```ts
engine.camera.onScaleChange((scale) => {
  if (scale < 0.5) {
    // hide tiny details
  } else if (scale > 2) {
    // show high-detail labels
  }
});
```
