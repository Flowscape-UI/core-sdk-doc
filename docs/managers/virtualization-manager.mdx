# VirtualizationManager

`VirtualizationManager` optimizes rendering by updating visibility of nodes based on viewport with a buffer zone and throttling.

## Enabling Virtualization

```ts
const engine = new CoreEngine({
  container,
  virtualization: {
    enabled: true,
    bufferZone: 400,
    throttleMs: 16,
  },
});
```

## How It Works

- Observes camera changes and updates
- Hides off-screen nodes to reduce draw cost
- Uses throttling to avoid excessive work
