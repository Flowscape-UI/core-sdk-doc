# Selection Plugin

Enables mouse selection of nodes, showing selection bounds.

## Usage

```ts
import { SelectionPlugin } from "@flowscape-ui/core-sdk";

const engine = new CoreEngine({ container, plugins: [new SelectionPlugin()] });
```

You can combine with `AreaSelectionPlugin` for drag-to-select behavior.
