# Event Bus

The SDK provides a typed `EventBus` for decoupled communication between managers, plugins, and your app.

## Usage

```ts
import { CoreEngine } from '@flowscape-ui/core-sdk';

const engine = new CoreEngine({ container });

// Subscribe
const unsubscribe = engine.eventBus.on('node:created', (node) => {
  console.log('Node created:', node.id);
});

// Emit (happens internally when nodes are created)
// engine.eventBus.emit('node:created', node)

// Unsubscribe
unsubscribe();
```

## Common Events

- `node:created` â€” fired when a node is added via `NodeManager`
- Additional events can be added by managers or plugins

The event types are defined in `CoreEvents` type and enforced at compile-time for safety.
